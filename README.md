PicturePhone! Is a game inspired by the Telephone Game. Unlike the Telephone Game, 
which only consists of verbal communication, this game is silent - connecting to what we had to 
make: a silent game. This game solely consisted of visual communication. Our concept is 
“hieroglyphics is design” because hieroglyphics are a system of writing mainly in pictorial 
characters. Implementing a picture-based writing system is basically what users are doing while 
playing this game. 

Each player has to understand the previous player’s message and express it in either text 
or drawing. It starts with a given text, and ends with a drawing. This is a collaborative practice, 
focusing on the manipulation of expressive form; drawing, in this case. 

This concept is supposed to provide entertainment by the unexpectedness of how the first 
drawing changed through several unknown stages until reaching the last drawing, rather than 
numeric values such as scores or elapsed time to reach the ending.



Players: 2 to 20+

Playtime: Based on the number of players
